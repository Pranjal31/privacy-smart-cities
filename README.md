# Privacy Concerns with Embracing Smart Cities
  -*Evaluating the impact of Chief Privacy Officer appointment on public privacy sentiment*

The project focuses on the impact the presence of a Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) has on peopleâ€™s adoption of smart cities. To deal with all privacy-related concerns for smart cities, we consider the notion of appointing a CPO for the smart city by drawing parallels with the industry. This idea has had significant success in the industry, because it ensures that there is an entire office dedicated to designing and implementing policies to protect user data. On the other hand, most smart cities lack such dedicated offices and executives while they are most vulnerable to different types of privacy attacks. We conduct a comprehensive user study to understand if citizens of a smart city would be more comfortable sharing their personal data with the government if their city appointed a CPO.
